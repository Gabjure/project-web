## Project Description


For my project I have selected de Star Wars API: SWAPI (swapi.co/api/). 

Issues encountered:

-Main Api is made up of SubApis.

-Information in the SubApis is a direct refrence to the other SupApis, meaning many of the columns of the SupApis are lists of links for other supapis.

-I was not able to create one dataframe with both images and clickable links because:

    1) To introduce the images in the DF It turned into: IPython.core.display.HTML which did not let me becaus: HTML' object has no attribute 'style' and to make the link clickable I was using: .style.format
    
    2) I could make a link clickable but when I turned it into an HTML object it would lose format.
